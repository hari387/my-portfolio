<h3 id="ray-tracing">Ray Tracing</h3>

<p>A friend and I built a ray tracer in pure C++, without any graphics libraries. We also gave it the functionality to raytrace <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.stl</code> files, and sped it up 3x by using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounding_volume_hierarchy">Bounding Volume Hierachy</a>. You can find the project <a href="https://github.com/hari387/architectural_raytracer">here</a>. It’s possible to speed it up even more using CUDA, but we decided to optimize for developer time.</p>

<p>If you’d like to do this yourself, <a href="https://github.com/RayTracing/raytracing.github.io">Ray Tracing in One Weekend</a> by Peter Shirley is an excellent resource.</p>

<h3 id="neural-network-sans-tensorflow">Neural Network <em>sans</em> Tensorflow</h3>

<p>I built a Neural Network class in Python without any machine learning frameworks and trained a network on the MNIST dataset up to a 90% accuracy. In the process, I learned a bunch about optimization, multivariable calculus, and more. You can access the project and run it <a href="https://repl.it/@mpm3/mllearning#network.py">here</a>.</p>

<p>Again, if you’d like to learn more about this, <a href="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/">Neural Networks and Deep Learning</a> by Michael Nielsen is a great book.</p>

<p>I built a fully functional grid version of <a href="slither.io">slither.io</a> in the browser using <a href="phaser.io">phaser.io</a>, a game engine made for the browser, and <a href="socket.io">socket.io</a>. You can find the project <a href="https://github.com/hari387/ekans.io">here</a>, or play it <a href="ekans-io.herokuapp.com">here</a>.</p>
