<p>Hi there! I’m Narahari Rao. I’m from San Jose, California, but I go to school in SoCal, where I study Computing at UC Santa Barbara. I’m also a STEP intern at Google for Summer 2020, so I’m not totally bored during quarantine. On this site you’ll hopefully find some good articles on topics I’ve encountered, as well as somewhat coherent rants on various things. Feel free to check out my <a href="/projects/index.html">projects</a> for some fun stuff I’ve made.</p>
